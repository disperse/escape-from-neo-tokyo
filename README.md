Documentation for the boilerplate code follows:

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm start` | Build project and open web server running project |
| `npm run build` | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..) |

## Customizing the Template

### Babel

You can write modern ES6+ JavaScript and Babel will transpile it to a version of JavaScript that you want your project to support. The targeted browsers are set in the `.babelrc` file and the default currently targets all browsers with total usage over "0.25%" but excludes IE11 and Opera Mini.

 ```
"browsers": [
  ">0.25%",
  "not ie 11",
  "not op_mini all"
]
 ```

### Webpack

If you want to customize your build, such as adding a new webpack loader or plugin (i.e. for loading CSS or fonts), you can modify the `webpack/base.js` file for cross-project changes, or you can modify and/or create new configuration files and target them in specific npm tasks inside of `package.json'.

## Deploying Code

After you run the `npm run build` command, your code will be built into a single bundle located at `dist/bundle.min.js` along with any other assets you project depended. 

If you put the contents of the `dist` folder in a publicly-accessible location (say something like `http://mycoolserver.com`), you should be able to open `http://mycoolserver.com/index.html` and play your game.
